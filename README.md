# üé¨ ProjAnimeRecommenderEngine

A machine learning‚Äìbased **Anime Recommendation System** that suggests anime titles based on a user‚Äôs watch history.  
It uses a neural network with user and anime embeddings to learn preferences and generate recommendations.

---

## üöÄ Features

- Recommends **10 anime titles** for a given user ID  
- Neural collaborative filtering model with embeddings  
- Model training and artifact management using **DVC**  
- Web API (Flask/FastAPI) for serving recommendations  
- Containerized with **Docker**, deployable on **Kubernetes** or **Cloud Run**  
- Configurable via YAML (`config/config.yaml`)

## üßë‚Äçüíª Model Architecture

The recommender model is a neural net with embeddings for users and anime items:

```python
user_embedding = Embedding(input_dim=n_users, output_dim=embedding_size)(user)
anime_embedding = Embedding(input_dim=n_anime, output_dim=embedding_size)(anime)

x = Dot(axes=2, normalize=True)([user_embedding, anime_embedding])
x = Flatten()(x)
x = Dense(1, kernel_initializer='he_normal')(x)
x = BatchNormalization()(x)
x = Activation("sigmoid")(x)

## Sample input: user_id
#sameple output: {
  "recommendations": [
    "Naruto",
    "One Piece",
    "Attack on Titan",
    "Bleach",
    "Death Note",
    "Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood",
    "My Hero Academia",
    "Dragon Ball Z",
    "Sword Art Online",
    "Fairy Tail"
  ]
}
